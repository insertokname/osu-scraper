This is a **very old** project and will be completley **unmentained**. I posted it so i can reference older code. This is a scraper that scraped 3 tb of maps of the osu servers.

To use the project you need to set the XSR_TOKEN and OSU_SESSION variables.

You can get them by sending a request to the osu download rest api and looking in your request headers.
